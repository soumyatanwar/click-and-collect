#Shrine 
 
Shopping Application for fashion and lifestyle products built for Android using Flutter and Dart (Frontend) which allows the user to search and filter through available products (locally stored data model instead of external database) based on the Material Design principles and case study of an application by the same name.

What's next?
1. Connect a database to the application 
2. Improve on the filter function (based on indexing using db - bestseller/most frequently searched)
3. Position the application as a 'click' and 'collect' solution that hybridises the shopping experience (inspired by my Bio Company experience and the state of brick and mortar stores facing competition from online retailers)
